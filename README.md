# Surfaces.txt new definition UDL
A simple UDL for highlighting surfaces.txt syntax in Notepad++.

I think the colors are a little bright, but you can adjust them how you like.

It may help to provide visual separation between animations and patterns, patterns and intervals/options, and make it more immediately clear when there is a typo in a drawing method, etc.

Also, coordinates set to 0,0 are dimmed. Please note that if the wait time parameter is also set to 0, it will be grayed out as well. This is not intentional, but I can't find a way to fix it, so just be mindful! If your wait time is 0 and your coordinates are also both 0, you should see *three* 0s, not two.
